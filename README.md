# Simple-CRUD-JSON
Simple CRUD program (HTML, Bootstrap 5, PHP, JS, JSON)

Features :
- Create data
- Read data
- Update data
- Delete data
- Delete all data
- Total data

- Error Handling

Note :
-
This is a simple To Do application using JSON.
To prevent this app from Javascript Injection, only alphabets and numbers are allowed.
In this case, I didn't use JSON_PRETTY_PRINT function, but you can use it if you want.
Fell free to modify this simple CRUD program, happy coding!
